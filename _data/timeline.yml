  description: Initially I worked as a front-end developer intern, implementing
               an interface with a team of 3 students. I eventually took the
               role of leader, planning deliverables and guiding my teammates
               towards writing both effective and maintainable code. I also
               designed a multi-tenancy system architecture for one of their
               platforms, which was approved and I have built the foundations
               using Laravel, PostgreSQL, and Docker until the end of my
               internship as a DevOps intern.

               different clients, mostly using Django or PHP. My most
               recent commission involves working with the Manila Wrestling
               Federation on getting their  own website for showcasing the
               organization's activities and the propagation of PH
               Wrestling as a proper sport and entertainment point.
