Hello, I'm Rian :wave: :wave: :wave:

I do Full-Stack Web Development, building websites from its insides to
what gets shown on the browser. I got acquainted with the web during my
Senior High School years, and I continued learning and building more
since then, both for academic projects and freelancing.
I have always been passionate about creating web-based solutions,
and the thrill of bringing a website or an API up and running gives me joy.

An experience that gave my skills validation was when I worked as an intern
for LexMeet Incorporated, a tech company creating solutions for lawyers in the
Philippines. I managed to whip up an architecture proposal for one of their
platforms, which was presented to the company stakeholders and was approved.
I have laid down the foundational backend of this platform and successfully
integrated the interfaces made by the other teams, and the company still
builds from this solution until now.
